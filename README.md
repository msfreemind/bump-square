## Bump Squares and Shuttle Squares

The player can only control certain marked squares by using the A, S or D keys. The A and D squares can bump (or block) the player's ball, whereas the S square can transport it. Using a combination of these squares, the player must direct the ball to the green goal square in order to complete a stage.
